# Crypto Analytics with ML and LLM Integration

This document is an initial draft of an idea to collect, process, store, and analyze crypto data from numerous sources and use numerous techniques to build out useful data including a task based system running queries, modules to analyze the data and fetch even more data based on what has been captured so far and analyze that new data. All of this culminating in a web interface allowing a report like style view driven by LLM.

## My Idea

The idea is to create a modular system that can pull data from various crypto data sources (APIs, on-chain data, social media, etc.), process and store this data in a structured format, and then use machine learning (ML) and large language models (LLMs) to analyze the data and generate insights.

Using LiveCoinWatch, CoinMarketCap, and CoinGecko we can get a pretty good list of all crypto projects. The API data contains lots of links. Each link should be parsed, use of LLM here... Let's use an example.

  },


```

The links section contains a lot of useful information. The website link can be parsed to find more information about the project, the whitepaper link can be used to extract technical details, and the social media links can be used to gauge community sentiment and engagement.

Digging deeper, each site can be passed to the LLM to create a nice dashboard website rich data. So, the website can get parsed for more information, but also sent to an LLM to provide a great summary. Recent post history may indicate what is being worked on, recent milestone achievements, other announcements, and more.

The whitepaper can be parsed for technical details, and the LLM can summarize the key points, goals, and innovations of the project.

Social media links can be monitored for sentiment analysis, community engagement, and trending topics related to the project. This can help identify potential risks or opportunities.

The system can also pull in market data (price, volume, market cap), on-chain data (transactions, smart contract interactions), and other relevant data points to build a comprehensive view of each project.

I'd like to see the data stored in a database where upon each fetch, if some of the fields are changed, they are stored in another table with the before and after value. The ML models can be used to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in the data, while the LLM can generate human-readable reports and insights based on the analysis.

Let's work with LiveCoinWatch first. They give us 10,000 credits every day. We need to analyze the documentation (and the current amount of tokens), and come up with the best way to use these tokens to get the most information on a regular interval.

The rest of the information below is important for considering system architecture but not important for understanding the initial system design focused on starting with LiveCoinWatch.

## Data Sources

## Additional notes

- Never suggest a paid service however I realize Twitter may be an exception. Fuck Musk.
