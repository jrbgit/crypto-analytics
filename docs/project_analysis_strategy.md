Looking at your database structure, you've built a solid foundation for tracking crypto projects with good change history and a flexible link management system. Let me analyze what you have and propose a comprehensive approach.

## Database Structure Analysis

**Strengths:**
- Change tracking (`project_changes`) is excellent for temporal analysis
- Separate `project_links` table allows multiple links per type
- `link_content_analysis` table shows you're already thinking about storing analyzed content
- Good mix of quantitative metrics (price, volume, market cap) and qualitative flags

**Observations:**
- The `link_content_analysis` table appears designed to cache LLM analysis results - smart for cost control
- `api_usage` table suggests you're tracking costs/rate limits
- Boolean flags like `is_active`, `needs_analysis`, `scrape_success` indicate an automated pipeline

## Strategic Data Collection & Analysis Framework

Let me break this down by priority and technical feasibility:

### **Tier 1: High-Value, Relatively Easy (Start Here)**

**Website Analysis:**
- Use `web_fetch` or similar to grab main page + key subpages (About, Team, Technology)
- For spidering: limit to 2-3 levels deep, same domain only
- Store in `link_content_analysis` with:
  - `technical_summary`: Tech stack, blockchain used, consensus mechanism
  - `key_points`: Core value propositions extracted
  - `entities`: Team members, partners, investors mentioned
  - `innovations`: Novel features or approaches
- **LLM Prompt Strategy**: "Extract: technology stack, core features, team composition, partnerships, unique value proposition, development stage"

**Whitepaper Analysis:**
- PDF handling: Use libraries like `pypdf2`, `pdfplumber`, or `pymupdf`
- Webpage whitepapers: Extract main content, strip navigation
- Store hash to detect updates (`content_hash`)
- **LLM Analysis**: 
  - Technical depth score (1-10)
  - Tokenomics summary
  - Use case viability
  - Competitive analysis present?
  - Red flags (plagiarism indicators, vague claims)

**Medium Articles:**
- RSS feeds often available: `https://medium.com/feed/@username`
- Track publication frequency
- Sentiment analysis on recent posts
- Topics covered (development updates vs marketing)

### **Tier 2: Social Sentiment (Medium Complexity)**

**Twitter/X:**
- Without API: Consider `nitter` instances (Twitter scrapers) or services like Apify
- With budget: Twitter API v2 (~$100/month for basic access)
- **Metrics to track:**
  - Tweet frequency (7d, 30d rolling average)
  - Engagement rate (likes+retweets per follower)
  - Sentiment score on recent tweets
  - Response time to community questions
  - Ratio of promotional vs educational content

**Reddit:**
- Use PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) - FREE for read-only
- Search for project mentions across crypto subreddits
- **Track:**
  - Mention frequency over time
  - Sentiment distribution
  - Presence of official community
  - Moderator activity (active community management indicator)
  - Post types (hype vs technical discussion ratio)

**Discord:**
- Requires bot + server invitation (challenging)
- Alternative: Track publicly stated member counts if displayed on website
- If you can get bot access:
  - Message frequency
  - Active user count (unique posters per week)
  - Response time from team/mods
  - Channel activity distribution

**Telegram:**
- Telegram Bot API is free and straightforward
- Can join public groups without special permissions
- **Track:**
  - Member count growth
  - Message frequency
  - Admin response patterns
  - Bot activity (spam indicator if excessive)
- **Challenge**: Many require groups to be public or need invite

### **Tier 3: Supplementary Metrics**

**YouTube:**
- YouTube Data API (free tier: 10,000 units/day)
- Track: video frequency, view counts, subscriber growth
- Analyze titles for content type (tutorials vs hype)

**LinkedIn:**
- No official API for scraping
- Track employee count if company page exists (growth indicator)
- Consider services like Bright Data or Apify

**Others (TikTok, Instagram, Twitch, etc.):**
- Most lack free APIs
- Consider: follower counts only, updated monthly
- Use services like Social Blade for aggregate data

## Proposed Analysis Pipeline

```
1. DISCOVERY PHASE (Weekly)
   ├─ Scan project_links for needs_analysis=true
   ├─ Prioritize by project market_cap/age
   └─ Queue links for processing

2. COLLECTION PHASE (Daily)
   ├─ Website: Fetch + spider (max 5 pages)
   ├─ Whitepaper: Download/fetch, extract text
   ├─ Social: API calls for metrics
   └─ Update last_scraped, scrape_success flags

3. ANALYSIS PHASE (Batched)
   ├─ Content Analysis (LLM)
   │   ├─ Batch 5-10 sites per LLM call (cost optimization)
   │   ├─ Generate summaries, scores, extract entities
   │   └─ Store in link_content_analysis
   │
   ├─ Sentiment Analysis
   │   ├─ Aggregate social media content
   │   ├─ Run sentiment model (local transformer)
   │   └─ Update social_sentiment_score in project_analysis
   │
   └─ Comparative Analysis
       ├─ Compare similar projects (by categories)
       ├─ Identify trend deviations
       └─ Flag unusual patterns

4. SCORING PHASE
   ├─ Calculate composite scores:
   │   ├─ technology_score (whitepaper + website tech depth)
   │   ├─ community_score (social engagement + growth)
   │   ├─ development_activity_score (GitHub + updates)
   │   └─ overall_score (weighted combination)
   │
   └─ Generate investment_recommendation

5. MONITORING PHASE (Continuous)
   ├─ Track project_changes for significant shifts
   ├─ Alert on: sudden sentiment drops, website changes, team departures
   └─ Refresh analysis for top-ranked projects monthly
```

## Database Enhancements to Consider

```sql
-- New table for social media metrics tracking
CREATE TABLE social_metrics (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    project_id INT REFERENCES crypto_projects(id),
    platform VARCHAR(50),  -- 'twitter', 'reddit', etc.
    followers INT,
    engagement_rate DECIMAL,
    post_frequency DECIMAL,  -- posts per day
    sentiment_score DECIMAL,
    collected_at TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(project_id, platform, collected_at::date)
);

-- Track website structure changes
CREATE TABLE website_snapshots (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    link_id INT REFERENCES project_links(id),
    page_structure_hash VARCHAR(64),
    key_sections JSONB,  -- {"team": true, "roadmap": true, ...}
    detected_changes JSONB,
    snapshot_date TIMESTAMP
);

-- Whitepaper versioning
CREATE TABLE whitepaper_versions (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    project_id INT REFERENCES crypto_projects(id),
    version VARCHAR(20),
    content_hash VARCHAR(64),
    page_count INT,
    word_count INT,
    technical_depth_score INT,
    key_changes TEXT,
    published_date DATE,
    discovered_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Practical Next Steps

1. **Start with Top 50 Projects by Market Cap**
   - Validate pipeline on known entities
   - Build confidence in analysis quality

2. **Implement Rate Limiting & Caching**
   - Respect robots.txt
   - Cache aggressively (update weekly for most content)
   - Use `updated_at` in tables to determine refresh needs

3. **LLM Cost Optimization**
   - Use Claude Haiku for initial categorization
   - Use Sonnet only for deep analysis of whitepapers
   - Batch similar content types together
   - Cache results aggressively using `content_hash`

4. **Build Progressive Enhancement**
   ```
   Phase 1: Website + Whitepaper analysis (core understanding)
   Phase 2: Add Twitter + Reddit (sentiment layer)
   Phase 3: Add remaining social (comprehensive view)
   Phase 4: Add change detection alerts (monitoring)
   ```

5. **Create Analysis Quality Metrics**
   - Track `analysis_confidence` in link_content_analysis
   - Flag when data is stale (>30 days)
   - Monitor scrape_success rates
